<pre>
classified point cloud data:    Classified point cloud data is provided in this collection in compressed LAZ format. Data are classified in accordance with ASPRS 2014 guidelines and contain return and intensity information. The average pulse spacing was 10.67 cm and the average density was 87.75 pts/m2 (fig. 2). Elevation surfaces interpolated from areas with a point density of fewer than 4pts/m2 were classified as no data.	
digital surface model:    The DSM represents surface elevations, including heights of vegetation, buildings, bridges, etc. The DSM is a single band, 32-bit GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
digital terrain model:    The DTM represents surface elevations of ground surfaces, excluding vegetation, bridges, buildings, etc. The DTM is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
lidar intensity image:    The lidar intensity image describes the relative amplitude of reflected signals contributing to the point cloud. Lidar intensity is largely a function of scanned object reflectance in relation to the signal frequency, is dependent on ambient conditions, and is not necessarily consistent between separate scans. The intensity image is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038 (32-bit, floating-point minimum).

Airborne survey - DGGS operates a Riegl VUX1-LR laser scanner integrated with a GNSS and Northrop Grumman IMU system. The integration was designed by Phoenix LiDAR systems. The sensor is capable of collecting up to 820,000 points per second over a distance of 150 m. This survey was flown with a pulse refresh rate between 200,000 and 400,000 pulses per second at a scan rate between 80 and 150 lines per second. This survey was flown with an average elevation of 400 m above ground level and a ground speed of approximately 40 m/s, using a Bell 206 helicopter. The scan angle was set from 55 to 305 degrees. The total area surveyed was approximately 73 km2. The airborne survey was flown December 8-12, 2020, using a Bell 206 helicopter. The weather throughout the survey was sub-optimal, with strong winds, light precipitation, and low-hanging clouds.
<dt>Date: 16-Dec-2020 (process 2 of 3)
<dd>
Ground survey - The DMLW collected 67 points using a Trimble R10 GNSS instrument. Of these points, 31 were used as control points, while 36 were used as checkpoints.
<dt>Date: 2020 (process 3 of 3)
<dd>
Lidar dataset processing - Point data were processed in SDCimport software for initial filtering and multiple-time-around (MTA) disambiguation. MTA errors, corrected in this process, are the result of imprecise interpretations of received pulse time intervals and occur more frequently with higher pulse refresh rates. IMU and GPS data were used to integrate flightline information with the point cloud in Spatial Explorer software. The point data were calibrated at an incrementally precise scale of sensor movement and behavior, incorporating sensor velocity, roll, pitch, and yaw fluctuations throughout the survey. Points were classified in accordance with American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) 2014 guidelines, using macros designed in Terrasolid software. Careful attention was given to the interpolation of the project's ground surface to compensate for inconsistent penetration through low vegetation as a function of the scan angle. Once classified, points underwent a geometric transformation and were converted from ellipsoidal heights to GEOID12B (Alaska) heights. Raster products were derived from the point cloud using ArcMap. The DTM was interpolated from all ground class returns using a tin-based method. The DSM was likewise interpolated from only the first returns for all classes. An intensity image was produced in ArcMap, using closest-to-mean binning.

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.1"><b>How well have the observations been checked?</b></a><br/>
Not applicable
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><br/>
Horizontal accuracy was not measured for this collection.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.3"><b>How accurate are the heights or depths?</b></a><br/>
A mean offset of 32.3 cm was measured between 31 control points and the point cloud. This offset was reduced to 0 by performing a vertical transformation of the lidar point data. Thirty-six checkpoints were used to determine the vertical accuracy of the point cloud ground class, using a tin-based approach. The final accuracy was calculated to have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 34.8 cm. See accompanying report for more detail.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></a><br/>
This data release is complete, and there is no over collect, except for the aircraft turns that were eliminated from the dataset.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><br/>
The data quality is consistent throughout the survey. The tests and processing methods used to ensure data consistency are further described in the accompanying report.
