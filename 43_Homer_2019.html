<pre>
classified point cloud data:    Classified point cloud data is provided in this collection in compressed *.LAZ format. Data are classified in accordance with ASPRS 2014 guidelines and contain return and intensity information. Elevation surfaces interpolated from areas with a point density of fewer than 4 pts/m2 were classified as no data.	
digital surface model:    DSMs represent surface elevations as they appear to the naked eye. They include the heights of vegetation, buildings, bridges, etc. The DSM is a single band, 32-bit GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 0.5 meters. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
digital terrain model:    DTMs represent surface elevations of ground surfaces, achieved by penetrating or flattening any vegetation, bridges, buildings, and other non-ground features. The DTM is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 0.5 meters. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
hydro-enforced digital terrain model:    The hydro-flattened DTM represents bare earth surfaces which have undergone a selective flattening process, where elevation values for any hydrologic features are replaced with a consistent, appropriate pixel (elevation) value. The hydro-enforced DTM is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 0.5 meters. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
lidar intensity image:    The lidar intensity image describes the relative amplitude of reflected signals contributing to the point cloud. Lidar intensity is largely a function of scanned object reflectance in relation to the signal frequency, is dependent on ambient conditions, and is not necessarily consistent between separate scans. The intensity image is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file with a ground sample distance of 0.5 meters. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038 (32-bit, floating-point minimum).

Airborne survey - DGGS operates a Riegl VUX1-LR laser scanner with a GNSS and Northrop Grumman Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The integration was designed by Phoenix LiDAR systems. The sensor can collect up to 820,000 points per second over a 150 m range. We flew the instrument with a repetition rate of 400,000 pulses per second, a scan speed of 200 revolutions per second, at approximately 200 m above ground level, and at a ground speed of approximately 40 meters per second with a fixed-wing Cessna 185. The scan look angle operated between 55 and 305 degrees. The total data coverage is approximately 98 km2. DGGS collected lidar data on June 3, 2019, initiating the GNSS base station at 08h48 and flying from 10h15 to 15h35 with a 15-minute refuel at 14h15. The sky was clear with light, easterly winds. Heavy air traffic precluded sufficient scanning of the southwestern portion of Beluga Lake and an area southeast of the Homer Airport runway (along Kachemak Drive).

Ground survey - The Alaska Division of Mining, Land, &amp; Water Survey Section collected 79 points in a targeted Ground Control Survey in Homer on June 19-20, 2019.
<dt>Date: 2020 (process 3 of 3)
<dd>
Lidar dataset processing - DGGS processed raw data by first using SDCImport to apply range thresholding, reflectance thresholding, and missed-time-around (MTA) disambiguation for preliminary point cloud noise filtering. We coupled in-flight IMU and GNSS data in Inertial Explorer to produce flight trajectory data and coupled the trajectory data with the raw point cloud in Spatial Explorer. We then used Terrasolid to calibrate point cloud data using tielines for roll, pitch, and yaw of the aircraft during the survey. We completed this process first for all points, then on a per-flight-line basis. For additional calibration, we identified interswath fluctuations in preliminarily-classified ground points using overlapping tielines. We classified the point cloud in accordance with American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) guidelines using project-tailored macros, resulting in a ground points class, as well as low, medium, and high vegetation (0.01-0.3 m, 0.3-5 m, and 5-60 m heights above the ground, respectively). Misclassified points were manually reclassified in post-processing QA/QC. We eliminated all low points and air points from the dataset and manually identified some buildings under dense vegetation, particularly in areas of complex terrain. We hydro-flattened the Bridge Creek Reservoir, Beluga Lake, and Lampert Lake to specified elevations. Lastly, we converted the point cloud from ellipsoidal to orthometric heights using GEOID 12B, then uniformly adjusted the dataset to maintain a mean offset of 0 m with collected ground control. All derivative products were created in ArcMap. The DTM and DSM were produced using point triangulation with nearest-neighbor interpolation. The DTM was derived from all returns for ground classified points, while the DSM used first returns for all non-noise classes. A lidar intensity image was created from first returns of all classes using mean binning.

<h3><a name="quality">How reliable are the data; what problems remain in the data set?</a></h3>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.1"><b>How well have the observations been checked?</b></a><br/>
Not applicable
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><br/>
Horizontal accuracy was not measured for this collection.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.3"><b>How accurate are the heights or depths?</b></a><br/>
The non-vegetated vertical accuracy for classified ground point data is a root mean square error of 3.1 cm. The average pulse spacing is 18.56 cm and the average point density is 29 points per square meter. See accompanying report for more detail.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></a><br/>
This dataset is a partial release of the June 3, 2019 lidar project. After the refuel stop, the survey moved across Kachemak Bay to scan the north-facing flank of the Grewingk Glacier valley (the site of a 1967 landslide into the proglacial lake). Data covering the Grewingk Glacier landslide scar will be published separately. However, data quality portrayed here for Homer and Kachemak is consistent throughout the entire dataset.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><br/>
The relative accuracy for this dataset is 10.38 cm RMSE, calculated as the interswath consistency. Heavy air traffic precluded sufficient scanning of the southwestern portion of Beluga Lake and an area southeast of the Homer Airport runway (along Kachemak Drive). The low-quality data at the southwest end of Beluga Lake has been clipped and flattened to lake level. The tests and processing methods used to ensure data consistency are further described in the accompanying report.
