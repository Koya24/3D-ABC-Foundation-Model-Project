classified points:    Classified point cloud data are provided in this collection in compressed LAZ format. Data are classified in accordance with ASPRS 2014 guidelines and contain return and intensity information. The average ground point spacing was 34 cm and the average density was 8.51 pts/m^2	
digital surface model:    The DSM represents surface elevations including heights of vegetation, buildings, bridges, and other structures. The DSM is a single band, 32-bit GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
digital terrain model:    The DTM represents surface elevations of ground surfaces, excluding vegetation, bridges, buildings, etc. The DTM is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
lidar intensity image:    The lidar intensity image describes the relative amplitude of reflected signals contributing to the point cloud. Lidar intensity is largely a function of scanned object reflectance in relation to the signal frequency, is dependent on ambient conditions, and is not necessarily consistent between separate scans. The intensity image is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to  3.40282306074e+038 (32-bit, floating-point minimum).

Aerial photogrammetric survey - DGGS used a Riegl VUX1-LR laser scanner integrated with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and Northrop Grumman LN-200C inertial measurement unit (IMU). The lidar integration system was designed by Phoenix LiDAR Systems. The sensor can collect up to 820,000 points per second over a distance of 150 m. This survey was flown with a pulse refresh rate of 400,000 pulses per second, at a scan rate between 80 and 220 lines per second. This survey was flown with an average elevation of 200 m above ground level and a ground speed of approximately 30 m/s with a fixed-wing configuration, using a Cessna 180. The scan angle was set from 80 to 280 degrees. The total area surveyed was approximately 1,595 km^2. Aerial lidar was collected between August 19 and 23, 2019. Seven flightlines collected on the evening of August 22 yielded too large a file for our software to process and the points from those lines are not represented in our final product.

Ground survey - Ground survey points from an UMIAQ, LLC, collection in September 2018, were used as control and checkpoint data for this dataset. These survey data were originally gathered in support of a USGS 3DEP funded lidar project, headed by Quantum Spatial (now NV5 Geospatial).
<dt>Date: 2022 (process 3 of 3)
<dd>
Photogrammetric dataset processing - Point data were processed in SDCimport software for initial filtering and multiple-time-around (MTA) disambiguation. MTA errors, corrected in this process, are the result of imprecise interpretations of received pulse time intervals and occur more frequently with higher pulse refresh rates. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data were processed in Inertial Explorer and used to integrate flightline information with the point cloud in Spatial Explorer software. The point data were calibrated at an incrementally precise scale of sensor movement and behavior, incorporating sensor velocity, roll, pitch, and yaw fluctuations throughout the survey. Points were classified in accordance with American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) 2014 guidelines, using macros designed in Terrasolid software. Once classified, points underwent a geometric transformation and were converted from ellipsoidal heights to GEOID12B (Alaska) orthometric heights. Raster products were derived from the point cloud using ArcGIS Pro. The DTM was interpolated from all ground class returns using a TIN-based method. The DSM was likewise interpolated from only the first return points. An intensity image was also produced in ArcGIS Pro, using closest-to-mean binning.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.1"><b>How well have the observations been checked?</b></a><br/>
Not applicable
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><br/>
Horizontal accuracy was not measured for this collection.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.3"><b>How accurate are the heights or depths?</b></a><br/>
A mean offset of -25.5 cm was measured between 19 control points and point cloud ground returns. This offset was reduced to 0.001 cm by performing a vertical transformation of the lidar point data. Thirty-three check points were used to determine the non-vegetated vertical accuracy (NVA) of the point cloud ground class, using a TIN-based approach. Project NVA was calculated to have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.2 cm. Relative accuracy for this dataset was evaluated as the interswath overlap consistency and was measured at 0.95 cm RMSE. See the accompanying report for check points and additional detail.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></a><br/>
This is a partial data release and contains all data collected except from the seven flightlines shown in figure 1 of the accompanying report. There is no over collect. The data quality is consistent throughout the survey.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><br/>
DGGS visually inspected the orthoimage for data errors such as shifts, seamline mismatches, and water noise overlapping land. There were no significantly erroneous areas that required repair.
