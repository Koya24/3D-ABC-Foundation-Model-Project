The Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) used aerial lidar to produce a classified point cloud, digital terrain model (DTM), surface model (DSM), and intensity model of land areas in northern Barry Arm, northwest Prince William Sound, Alaska, during near snow-free ground conditions on June 26, 2020. The goal of the survey is to provide high quality, modern topographic data in the recently deglacierized part of Barry Arm where significant landslide hazards exist. Aerial lidar and ground control data were collected on June 26, 2020, and subsequently processed in Terrasolid and ArcGIS. Ground control was collected on June 26, 2020, as well. All files can be downloaded free of charge from the Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys website (<a href="http://doi.org/10.14509/30589)">http://doi.org/10.14509/30589)</a>.

<pre>
classified point cloud data:    Classified point cloud data is provided in this collection in compressed LAZ format. Data are classified in accordance with ASPRS 2014 guidelines and contain return and intensity information. The average pulse spacing was 7.2 cm and the average density was 12.05 pts/m2.	
digital surface model:    The DSM represents surface elevations including heights of vegetation, buildings, bridges, etc. The DSM is a single band, 32-bit GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
digital terrain model:    The DTM represents surface elevations of ground surfaces, excluding vegetation, bridges, buildings, etc. The DTM is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
lidar intensity image:    The lidar intensity image describes the relative amplitude of reflected signals contributing to the point cloud. Lidar intensity is largely a function of scanned object reflectance in relation to the signal frequency, is dependent on ambient conditions, and is not necessarily consistent between separate scans. The intensity image is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038 (32-bit, floating-point minimum).	
hydro-enforced digital terrain model:    The hydro-enforced DTM represents bare earth surfaces which have undergone a selective &quot;flattening&quot; process, where elevation values for any hydrologic features, as well as any hydrologic obstacles (bridges, culverts, etc.), are replaced with neighboring pixel values. The hydro-enforced DTM is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of 1 meter. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.

Airborne survey - DGGS used a Riegl VUX1-LR laser scanner integrated with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and Northrop Grumman LN-200C inertial measurement unit (IMU). The lidar integration system was designed by Phoenix LiDAR Systems. The sensor is capable of collecting up to 820,000 points per second over a distance of 150 m. This survey was flown with a pulse refresh rate between 200,000 and 600,000 pulses per second at a scan rate between 80 and 150 lines per second. This survey was flown with an average elevation of 200 m above ground level and a ground speed of approximately 36 m/s with a fixed-wing aircraft configuration, using a Cessna 180 aircraft. The scan angle was set from 80 to 280 degrees. The total area surveyed was approximately 40 km2. Flight take-off occurred at 10:15am from Merrill Field airport in Anchorage, Alaska, and landing occurred at 4:00 pm. The aircraft landed at the airstrip in Girdwood, Alaska, once during the survey.
<dt>Date: 26-Jun-2020 (process 2 of 3)
<dd>
Ground survey - Ground control and check points were collected on June 26, 2020. A Trimble R10-2 GNSS receiver with internal antenna was deployed on the ridge near the center of the study and provided a base station occupation and real-time kinematic (RTK) corrections to points surveyed with a rover Trimble R10-2 GNSS receiver (internal antenna). A total of 106 ground control points and check points were collected to be used for calibration and assessment of the vertical accuracy of the point cloud. All points were collected on bare earth or minimally vegetated surface.
<dt>Date: 2020 (process 3 of 3)
<dd>
Lidar dataset processing - Point data were processed in SDCimport software for initial filtering and multiple-time-around (MTA) disambiguation. MTA errors, corrected in this process, are the result of imprecise interpretations of received pulse time intervals and occur more frequently with higher pulse refresh rates. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data were processed in Inertial Explorer and used to integrate flightline information with the point cloud in Spatial Explorer software. The point data were calibrated at an incrementally precise scale of sensor movement and behavior, incorporating sensor velocity, roll, pitch, and yaw fluctuations throughout the survey. Points were classified in accordance with American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) 2014 guidelines, using macros designed in Terrasolid software. Careful attention was given to the interpolation of the project's ground surface to compensate for inconsistent penetration through low vegetation as a function of the scan angle. Once classified, points underwent a geometric transformation and were converted from ellipsoidal heights to GEOID12B (Alaska) orthometric heights. Raster products were derived from the point cloud using ArcMap. The DTM was interpolated from all ground class returns using a TIN-based method. The DTM was also used to produce a separate hydro-enforced raster based on a digitized shoreline. The DSM was likewise interpolated from only the first return points using a TIN-based method. An intensity image was also produced in ArcMap, using closest-to-mean binning.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.1"><b>How well have the observations been checked?</b></a><br/>
Not applicable
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><br/>
Horizontal accuracy was not measured for this collection.

<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.3"><b>How accurate are the heights or depths?</b></a><br/>
A mean offset of -19.7 cm was measured between 84 control points and the point cloud (appendix 1). This offset was reduced to -0.6 cm by performing a vertical transformation of the lidar point data. Twenty-two check points were used to determine the non-vegetated vertical accuracy (NVA) of the point cloud ground class, using a TIN-based approach. Project NVA was calculated to have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.7 cm. See accompanying report for more detail.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></a><br/>
This data release is complete, and there is no over collect except for aircraft turns that were eliminated from the dataset.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><br/>
Relative accuracy for this dataset was evaluated as the interswath overlap consistency and was measured at 8.3 cm RMSE. The data quality is consistent throughout the survey.
