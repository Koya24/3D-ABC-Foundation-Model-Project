Airborne survey - This lidar survey was flown at an average elevation of 200 m above ground level and a ground speed of approximately 40 meters per second with a fixed-wing Cessna 180. Elevation data were acquired with a Riegl VUX1-LR laser scanner integrated with a GNSS and Northrop Grumman IMU system. The integration was designed by Phoenix LiDAR systems. Lidar data were acquired at a pulse rate ranging from 50,000 pulses per second in the alpine areas to 400,000 pulses per second over forested areas, a scan rate of 200 revolutions per second, and a scan angle range of 80-280 degrees. The accompanying report provides additional detail regarding flight conditions.
<dt>Date: 02-Sep-2018 (process 2 of 3)
<dd>
Ground survey - Ground control and check points were collected on September 2, 2018. A Trimble R7 GNSS receiver with Zephyr-2 antenna was deployed near the center of the study area and provided a base station occupation and real-time kinematic (RTK) corrections to points surveyed with a rover Trimble R8-4 GNSS receiver (internal antenna). 78 total ground control points and check points were collected to be used for calibration and assessment of the vertical accuracy of the point cloud. All points were collected on a paved road surface.
<dt>Date: 2019 (process 3 of 3)
<dd>
Lidar dataset processing - Raw data were processed using Terrasolid software to produce integrated files for navigation correction and a point cloud for calibration. The navigation was corrected using Inertial Explorer software, where the GNSS and IMU data are integrated to establish correct flight path and orientation of the lidar sensor. Internal consistency of the dataset was improved by calibrating the point cloud data using global, flight line, and fluctuation (within individual flightlines) tielines in Terrasolid software. The point cloud was classified for ground points as well as low, medium, and high vegetation (0.01-0.5 m, 0.5-3 m, and 3-60 m heights above the ground, respectively, in accordance with ASPRS lidar classification codes). Some manual processing was required to eliminate erratically placed points and misclassified ground points. All low points and air points were eliminated from the dataset. A LAS dataset was created in ArcMAP, from which a 50 cm DTM, DSM, and intensity image were produced. The DTM was derived from elevation values of ground-classified points only, and built using the binning technique of minimum elevation and linear void fill. The DSM was derived from elevation values from first returns from all point classes, and built using the binning technique of average elevation values and linear void fill. The intensity image was derived from intensity values of first return points.

The elevation values of 62 ground control points were compared with the elevation values of the lidar points classified as ground points. The average vertical offset was corrected with a z-transformation. 15 check points were used to determine the final accuracy of the z-transformed lidar point cloud. The lidar point cloud had a vertical offset of +2.2 cm (root mean squared error [RMSE] 3.6 cm) compared to ground control, therefore a vertical transformation of -2.2 cm was applied to the lidar point cloud. The final accuracy assessment showed a mean vertical offset of -0.3 cm and RMSE of 3.3 cm. Relative accuracy for this dataset was evaluated as the interswath overlap consistency and was measured at 1.2 cm RMSE.

This data release is complete and there is no over collect, except for the aircraft turns that were eliminated from the dataset. There are a few areas where data coverage is limited due to laser range exceedance, which is related to the slow response of the fixed wing aircraft to the fast elevation change along the flight path. All low points and air points were eliminated from the dataset.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><br/>
Relative accuracy for this dataset was evaluated as the interswath overlap consistency and was measured at 1.2 cm RMSE.
