High-resolution lidar data from the west Susitna area, Southcentral, Alaska

</dd>
<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

The Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys used airborne lidar to produce a digital terrain model (DTM) and digital surface model (DSM) for the west Susitna area, about 65 km (40 mi) west of Wasilla, Alaska. Airborne data were collected November 4-10, 2019, and subsequently processed in Terrasolid and ArcGIS. Ground control data were concurrently collected by DGGS. All files can be downloaded free of charge from the Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys website (<a href="http://doi.org/10.14509/30455">&lt;http://doi.org/10.14509/30455&gt;</a>).

<pre>
point cloud data:    Classified lidar values. Points were classified in accordance with ASPRS 2014 guidelines. 	
digital surface model:    DSMs represent surface elevations, as they appear to the naked eye. They include the heights of vegetation, buildings, bridges, etc. The DSM is a single band, 32-bit GeoTif file, with a ground sample distance of .5 meters. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.	
digital terrain model:    DTMs represent surface elevations of ground surfaces, excluding vegetation, bridges, buildings, etc. The DTM is a single-band, 32-bit float GeoTIFF file, with a ground sample distance of .5 meters. No Data value is set to -3.40282306074e+038.

Data acquisition - DGGS operates a Riegl VUX1-LR lidar integrated with a GNSS and Northrop Grumman IMU system. The integration was designed by Phoenix LiDAR systems. The sensor is capable of collecting up to 820,000 points per second over a distance of 150 m. This survey was flown at a pulse rate between 200,000 and 400,000 pulses per second, at a scan rate between 80 and 150 loops per second. The average pulse spacing was 31.27 cm and the average density was 10.23 pts/m2. This survey was flown with an average elevation of 1,000 m above ground level and a ground speed of approximately 40 m/s with a fixed wing aircraft configuration, using a Cessna 185 aircraft. The scan angle was set from 55 to 305 degrees. Airborne data were collected November 4-10, 2019. Weather conditions were generally sub-optimal throughout the survey, requiring operations to take place in thick fog and low-lying clouds, at the risk of increased levels of noise in the product. Snow was present across the majority of the study area surface and accumulated throughout the survey period, especially in the northernmost section.
<p>
<dt>Date: 2020 (process 2 of 3)
<dd>
Point classification - Point cloud data was run through SDCimport software for initial filtering and disambiguation of errors. Once filtered, the point cloud and trajectory data were fused together by integrating IMU and GPS information. Points were classified in accordance with ASPRS 2014 guidelines. A significant amount of noise, due to snow and weather conditions during the survey, was separated from the rest of the data and designated to class 8, model keypoints. All classified points were vertically transformed to maintain a mean offset fewer than 10 cm from surveyed ground control.
<p>
<dt>Date: 2020 (process 3 of 3)
<dd>
Raster products - Raster products were produced from las files in ArcMap and were clipped according to a lidar point density threshold of 8pts/m2. DTM and DSM were created using a tin-based method.

Airborne data were collected on November 4-10, 2019. Weather conditions were generally sub-optimal throughout the survey, requiring operations to take place in thick fog and low-lying clouds, at the risk of increased levels of noise in the product. Snow was present across the majority of the study area surface and accumulated throughout the survey period, especially in the northernmost section. Weather conditions and snow cover resulted in variability of point density throughout the study area. See accompanying report for further discussion of data verification procedures.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><p>
Trimble R8 and R9 RTK GPS systems were used to collect ground control points (GCPs). Seventy-five checkpoints were used to calculate a vertical accuracy of 39 cm RMSE. Internal consistency for the point cloud data was measured at 6.5cm across the project. Points were adjusted for accuracy, according to OPUS corrections, in Trimble Business Center. See accompanying report for a table of checkpoints and further discussion of factors impacting the certainty of data locations.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.3"><b>How accurate are the heights or depths?</b></a><p>
Seventy-five checkpoints were used to calculate a vertical accuracy of 39 cm RMSE. Relative accuracy was evaluated as the interswath consistency and was measured at 2.1 cm RMSE. The quality of the data is the average elevation compared to an independent dataset. The second aspect of the quality of the data is related to point density distribution over the survey area. The average point density is 10.23 points per square meter. A table of checkpoints and errors is provided in the accompanying report.
<p>

<li><a name="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></a><p>
