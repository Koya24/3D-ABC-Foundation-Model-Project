<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

This publication presents lidar data collected over the community of Golovin, on the southern coast of the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska (fig. 1). The original data were collected on November 5, 2013, by Quantum Spatial. The complete, classified lidar dataset was purchased by the State of Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys in 2014 in support of coastal vulnerability mapping efforts. For the purposes of open access to lidar datasets in coastal regions of Alaska, this collection is being released as a Raw Data File with an open end-user license. The horizontal datum for this dataset is NAD83 (CORS96), the vertical datum is NAVD88, Geoid 09, and it is projected in UTM Zone 3 North. Units are in Meters. Data have been classified to Ground (class 2) and Default (class 1). Quantum Spatial collected the Golovin LiDAR data on 11/05/2013.

The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to include elements that are required to facilitate our internal data management. These elements, referred to as &quot;layers,&quot; group and describe files that have intrinsic logical or topological relationships and correspond to subdirectories within the data distribution package. The metadata layer provides an FGDC metadata file and may include other documentation files. Attribute information for each data layer is described in this metadata file under the &quot;Entity_and_Attribute_Information&quot; section. Data layer contents:

Acquisition. Quantum Spatial collected the Golovin lidar data on 11/05/2013.  The survey used a Optech Gemini laser system mounted in a Piper Navajo.  Data was collected using a single pulse flight plan.  Ground level GPS and aircraft IMU were collected during the flight.
Optech Gemini  Instrument Parameters:
Beam diameter: 26 cm,
Pulse rate: 70 kHz,
Maximum returns: 4,
Field of view (FOV): 40 degrees,
Beam wavelength: 1064 nm,
Frequency of GPS sampling: 2 Hz,
Frequency of IMU sampling: 200 Hz,
AGL: 800 m,
Average pulse density: 4
<p>
<dt>Date: 16-Sep-2014 (process 2 of 6)
<dd>
1. Flight lines and data were reviewed to ensure complete coverage of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points.
2. Laser point return coordinates were computed based on independent data from the lidar system, IMU, and aircraft.
3. The raw lidar file was assembled into flight lines per return with each point having an associated x, y, and z coordinate.
4. Visual inspection of swath to swath laser point consistencies within the study area were used to perform manual refinements of system alignment.
5. Custom algorithms were designed to evaluate points between adjacent flight lines. Automated system alignment was computed based upon randomly selected swath to swath accuracy measurements that consider elevation, slope, and intensities. Specifically, refinement in the combination of system pitch, roll and yaw offset parameters optimize internal consistency.
6. Noise (e.g., pits and birds) was filtered based on known elevation ranges and included the removal of any cycle slips.
7. Using TerraScan and Microstation, ground classifications utilized custom settings appropriate to the study area.
8. The corrected and filtered return points were compared to the RTK ground survey points collected to verify the vertical accuracy.
9. Data were classified to Ground (class 2) and Default (class 1).

<h3><a name="quality">How reliable are the data; what problems remain in the data set?</a></h3>
<ol>
<li><a name="quality.1"><b>How well have the observations been checked?</b></a><p>
Accuracy statements are based on areas of moderate terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation. The accuracy of each point is expected to meet the vertical accuracy standard, however, derived products may be less accurate in extreme terrain and dense vegetation due to a lesser number of points defining the bare-earth in these areas. Questions regarding data accuracy can be best answered by Quantum Spatial (Anchorage, Alaska) staff.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></a><p>
The Optech Gemini system has a stated horizontal accuracy of 1/5500 x altitude.  The Golovin lidar data was flown at 800m AGL resulting in a horizontal accuracy of 15 cm.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.3"><b>How accurate are the heights or depths?</b></a><p>
The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the vertical accuracy of this dataset is 0.107 m.  Accuracy was assessed using 15 ground survey points. Please see the lidar data report for a discussion of the statistics related to this dataset. The vertical accuracy of the lidar dataset was independently evaluated by DGGS using control points (n=10) that were collected by DGGS during the course of 2012 fieldwork. The standard deviation of the differences between these independent control points and the lidar point-cloud data confirmed the vertical accuracy reported by Quantum Spatial in the 2014 delivery report.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.4"><b>Where are the gaps in the data?  What is missing?</b></a><p>
LiDAR data has been collected and processed for all areas within the project study area.  AKDGGS's area of interest (AOI) was larger in extent than the previous AOI for which the data was acquired. This resulted in small but unavoidable data gaps along the northern boundary and lower point densities in the eastern section of the AOI not specifically targeted during the acquisition.  All discernible laser returns from the fall 2013 acquisition were processed to aid AKDGGS in assessing the topographic and geophysical properties of the study area to support storm monitoring.
<p>
</li>
<li><a name="quality.5"><b>How consistent are the relationships among the observations, including topology?</b></a><p>
Shaded relief images have been visually inspected for data errors such as pits, border artifacts, and shifting. LiDAR flight lines have been examined to ensure consistent elevation values across overlapping flight lines.  The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of line to line relative accuracy  for this dataset is 0.035 m.  Please see the LiDAR data report for a discussion of the statistics related to this dataset.
